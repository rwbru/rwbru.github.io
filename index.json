[{"content":" Health Psychology Group now | 01/2024 University of Bamberg Research associate position investigating real-world dimensions of human heat behavior. Using mobile in situ/EMA methods, the project's objectives are to better understand structural obstacles in thermal stress protection for particularly vulnerable groups and to explore conditions under which health and well-being can be improved systematically in heat situations. Responsibilities include: Conceptualization and methodological development of the study Technical implementation and administration of EMA/ESM infrastructure Research data management and analysis Project Group for Computational Epidemiology 12/2023 05/2022 Robert Koch-Institute | Humboldt University Berlin Research assistant to the Corona Data Donation project together with Prof. Dirk Brockmann's group for Computational Epidemiology. The project group is part of the Working Group Complex Biological Systems at the Institute for Theoretical Biology and at the IRI Life Sciences at the HU Berlin.
